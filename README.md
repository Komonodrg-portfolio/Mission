# üåç Mission

## üåê Overview

Welcome to my Mission Repo ‚Äì a personal and professional journey combining continuous learning in Cybersecurity, Network Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence, with a mission to empower others, especially those in underdeveloped regions & underserverd communities, through open access to knowledge, tools, and real-world use cases.

This repository is more than a **portfolio** ‚Äì it's a commitment to use technology as a force for positivity, both domestically and abroad globally.

## üöÄ Mission Goals
### ü§ù 1. **Provide Training Materials Globally**

My goal is to create structured, beginner-friendly training and project materials in Cybersecurity, Networking, Media Creation all while leveraging AI, specifically designed for learners of all walks. The main focal points:

- **Open-access educational materials**
    
- **Low-bandwidth (cost) friendly resources**
    
- **Translatable content & culturally relevant examples**
    
- **GitHub-based learning & collaboration**
    
- **Remote mentoring opportunities (coming soon)**
  
This mission is driven by the belief that **access to digital skills can change lives**, unlock careers, and foster innovation globally.

  <br> 
<em>The summer of 2024 was an exciting time for me!  Being the son of immigrants, it was cool getting a chance to take a trip to visit the continent of my parents origin - icing on the cake was being able to travel to Kenya with my Mom (bucket list item - ‚úîÔ∏è!)  We spent a little under a month traveling the country (literally from mountain to coast) taking in the wonders Kenya had to offer.  From the beaches of Mombasa/Nyali, to a safari in Nairobi, fishing Lake Victoria, & spending sometime in the mountains of Kisii to visit with friends, it was the trip of a lifetime.<br>  
<br> 
Coming back to the US was bittersweet.  Though I missed my wife and kids tremendously while gone, I couldn't shake this feeling to give back to a people who gave so much to us while on our journeys.  Specifically, I thought of the kids in a village where we attended church one Saturday(pic below) and spent a while considering how I best could leverage my talents to help them be all they could aspire to be in this lifetime, despite the extreme hardships felt in remote/rural communities.  My answer and love letter to them and all the lifelong friends met along the way: creating this repo.</em><br>
<br>
<b>My Vision:</b><br>
    
- <b>To partner or create a foundation that will provide repurposed/decommissioned cellphones / laptops to individuals in remote area</b>
- <b>Provide scholarships to cover the costs for IT Certifications to individuals showing deep aptitude, skill, and readiness</b><br>
