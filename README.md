<h1>🏁 Mission</h1> 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h2>🌐 Overview</h2>
<h3>🌍 Mission: Empower Through Tech – Cybersecurity, Networking, Media, & AI</h3>

Welcome to my Mission Repo – a personal and professional journey combining continuous learning in Cybersecurity, Network Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence, with a mission to empower others, especially those in underdeveloped regions & underserverd communities, through open access to knowledge, tools, and real-world use cases.

This repository is more than a portfolio – it's a commitment to use technology as a force for positivity, both domestically and abroad globally.

<h3>🚀 Mission Goals</h3>

My goal is to create structured, beginner-friendly training and project materials in Cybersecurity, Networking, Media Creation all while leveraging AI, specifically designed for learners of all walks.  The main focal points:

- <b>Open-access & open source educational materials 
- <b>Low-bandwidth <u>(cost)</u> friendly resources</b>
- <b>Easy to follow content & culturally relevant & real-world examples</b>
- <b>GitHub-based learning & collaboration</b>
- <b>Remote mentoring opportunities (coming soon)</b>

I hope
